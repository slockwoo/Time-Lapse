# Time-lapse

This is a time-lapse software created for a project in ECEN 5623 - Real-Time Embedded Systems. Some high level requirements include capturing images at 1 Hz, converting them to .ppm format, appending timestamp and system information to the images' header, and saving the images. At least 2 threads needed to be used, and rate-monotonic policy had to be followed.
